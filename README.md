# ProgrammingWithDatabase

Programming with Java isn't an appeal to many due to its strict nature with syntax and some redundancies that may come with the language.
However, Java is very useful as a machine would only need a JVM that would contain a dedicated compiler which allows any Java programs to run under any machine as long as the JVM conforms to the a set of specifications. Hence, interoperability is ensured.
